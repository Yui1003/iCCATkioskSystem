## Navigation Route Fix (Nov 21, 2025 - 11:59 AM):

[x] 446. Diagnosed navigation routing issue - routes ending at snapped projection points instead of destination buildings
[x] 447. Architect identified root cause: projection snapping within 10m causing routes to end at intermediate buildings (like Gate 2)
[x] 448. Implemented fix: route endpoints now always use actual building coordinates after Dijkstra pathfinding
[x] 449. Added conditional replacement of first/last route points to ensure correct start/end locations
[x] 450. Architect reviewed and approved fix with Pass status
[x] 451. Fix ensures destination markers appear at intended buildings, not intermediate waypoints
[x] 452. All tasks completed successfully

## Environment Recovery (Nov 21, 2025 - 11:50 AM):

[x] 440. Restarted workflow successfully - server running on port 5000
[x] 441. Verified frontend loads correctly (iCCAT homepage with live clock at 11:50:40 AM)
[x] 442. Service Worker registered successfully
[x] 443. App running in fallback mode with data.json (Firebase not configured)
[x] 444. All migration tasks confirmed as complete
[x] 445. Progress tracker updated with latest recovery status

## Offline Map Tile Caching Fix (Nov 21, 2025 - 11:24 AM):

[x] 429. Diagnosed offline map tile caching failure - tiles weren't being cached despite Service Worker code
[x] 430. Fixed subdomain selection algorithm to use Math.abs(x + y) % 3 matching Leaflet's exact logic
[x] 431. Expanded tile coverage to zoom levels 16-19 (previously 17-18) for comprehensive coverage
[x] 432. Widened campus bounds from 0.001 to 0.002 degrees for better area coverage
[x] 433. Bumped Service Worker cache version from v3 to v4 to force re-installation
[x] 434. Added detailed console logging for tile caching progress (success/failure counts)
[x] 435. Improved activate event logging to track old cache cleanup
[x] 436. Architect confirmed implementation is correct - tile URLs now match Leaflet's requests
[x] 437. Workflow restarted - Service Worker v4 deployed

### 🧪 Testing Instructions - IMPORTANT:

Service Workers are cached aggressively by browsers. To test the offline tile caching:

**Step 1: Force New Service Worker Installation**
1. Open DevTools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
2. Go to **Application** tab > **Service Workers** section
3. Click **Unregister** on the old "sw.js" worker (if present)
4. Check the **Update on reload** checkbox
5. Hard refresh the page: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)

**Step 2: Verify Tile Pre-Caching**
1. Go to **Console** tab in DevTools
2. Look for Service Worker installation logs:
   ```
   [Service Worker] Installing version 4
   [Service Worker] Cached 100 OpenStreetMap tiles
   [Service Worker] Successfully pre-cached X map tiles at zoom levels 16-19
   ```
3. Go to **Application** tab > **Cache Storage**
4. Expand the **iccat-v4** cache
5. Verify you see many `tile.openstreetmap.org` URLs (should be ~100+ tiles)

**Step 3: Test Offline Map Display**
1. Still in DevTools, go to **Network** tab
2. Check the **Offline** checkbox (top of Network tab)
3. Refresh the page - app should still work
4. Navigate to **Campus Navigation** page
5. Click on any building - **the map tiles should display** even while offline
6. Uncheck **Offline** when done testing

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Map tiles load and display while offline
- ✅ Navigation arrows and turn-by-turn directions still work
- ✅ All building markers are visible on the map
- ✅ Console shows Service Worker serving tiles from cache

**Troubleshooting:**
- If tiles still don't appear offline: Verify "iccat-v4" cache contains tile URLs in Cache Storage
- If old Service Worker persists: Try opening in Incognito/Private window
- If OpenStreetMap rate limits: Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh to retry tile downloads

### Technical Details:

**Tile Coverage Specifications:**
- Zoom levels: 16, 17, 18, 19 (4 levels for smooth zooming)
- Campus bounds: 14.2448-14.2488 lat, 120.8788-120.8828 lng
- Tile count: ~100-150 tiles total (efficient offline coverage)
- Subdomains: a, b, c (matching Leaflet's rotation)

**What Was Fixed:**
- Old v3: Used `(x + y) % 3` for subdomain selection (incorrect)
- New v4: Uses `Math.abs(x + y) % 3` matching Leaflet's exact algorithm
- Result: Pre-cached tile URLs now match the ones Leaflet requests at runtime

## Offline Capability Status:
✅ **Works Offline After First Visit:**
- Navigation with route calculation (walking/driving)
- Events and announcements viewing
- Staff directory searching
- Building information browsing
- Map tiles display (cached from OpenStreetMap)

✅ **Improvements Made:**
- Client-side pathfinding (no server needed)
- Cache-first data loading
- Offline indicator shows connectivity status
- Service Worker survives offline installation
- CacheStorage fallback when fetch fails

⚠️ **Known Limitation:**
- First visit while completely offline won't work (no cached data yet)
- Requires one online visit to cache data
- Typical kiosk deployment sets up while online, so this is rare edge case
