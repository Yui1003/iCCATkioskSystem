Do NOT rewrite or modify the map system.
Only generate accurate, correct icon images for all POI types listed below.

I want you to generate PNG or SVG icons that clearly and accurately represent each POI.
The icons must be visually consistent: simple, flat-style, minimal, easy to recognize on a map.

You must NOT use random or unrelated symbols.
You must NOT reuse the same icon for different POIs.
You must NOT assign incorrect meanings (example: do NOT use a padlock for Gate).
